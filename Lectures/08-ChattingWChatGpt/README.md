### Question

How do I write a pygame class that implements a guided missile?

### Answer

To write a pygame class that implements a guided missile, you can follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary modules

```pyhon
import pygame
import math
```

2. Create a class for the guided missile

```python
class GuidedMissile:
    def __init__(self, x, y, angle):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.angle = angle
        self.image = pygame.image.load("missile.png")
        self.speed = 10
        self.rotation_speed = 5
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (self.x, self.y)
```

3. Define a method for updating the missile's position and angle

```python

    def update(self, target):
        dx = target.x - self.x
        dy = target.y - self.y
        distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
        if distance != 0:
            self.angle = math.degrees(math.atan2(-dy, dx))
            self.x += math.cos(math.radians(self.angle)) * self.speed
            self.y += math.sin(math.radians(self.angle)) * self.speed
            self.rect.center = (self.x, self.y)

```

4. Define a method for rotating the missile image

```python
    def rotate(self):
        self.image = pygame.transform.rotate(self.image, self.rotation_speed)
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=self.rect.center)
```

5. Define a method for drawing the missile on the screen

```python
    def draw(self, screen):
        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
```

6. In the main game loop, create an instance of the guided missile class and update its position and angle, rotate the missile image, and draw the missile on the screen

```python
    missile = GuidedMissile(100, 100, 0)
    target = Target(200, 200)
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        missile.update(target)
        missile.rotate()
        missile.draw(screen)
        pygame.display.update()
```

> Note: This code assumes that you have already created a Target class to represent the target that the missile is aiming for.

Since you mentioned target class, could you show me a basic class implementation of a targeted object?
Sure! Here's an example implementation of a Target class that you can use in conjunction with the GuidedMissile class:

```python
class Target:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.image = pygame.image.load("target.png")
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (self.x, self.y)

    def draw(self, screen):
        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
```

This `Target` class has an `__init__` method that takes in an `x` and `y`coordinate, loads an image for the target, and creates a rect object for the target's position on the screen. It also has a draw method that can be used to draw the target on the screen.

To use this `Target` class with the `GuidedMissile` class, you can create an instance of the Target class in your main game loop and pass it as an argument to the `GuidedMissile`'s `update` method.
