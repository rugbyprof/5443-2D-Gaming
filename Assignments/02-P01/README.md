## Program 1 - Tiled Game or Tetris
#### Due: 02-13-2023 (Monday @ 2:30 p.m.)


## Overview

Create one of the following games using the pygame library:

- 2048
- Hangman
- Minesweeper
- Sudoku
- Tetris
- Wordle


### Requirements

- Your game should re-create gameplay true to the rules and approximate look of the original game.
- Graphics should not be taken from the original game, but from a best attempt at finding [properly licensed assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_license) on the web.
- Each game should have some kind of animation. This means some implemented motion that will start and stop appropriately based on some event. 
  - 2048: moving and combining tiles based on arrow keys
  - Hangman: building the actual hangman
  - Minesweeper: explosion
  - Sudoku: number flying in to proper cell
  - Tetris: rotating and moving of shapes
  - Wordle: flying in of letters when a word is entered
- Collision detection need be implemented where appropriate. 


### Helper Code

- There are some starter code samples [here](helper_code/README.md). No game implementation 


## Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P01` in your `Assignments` folder.
- Add a file to your folder called `game.py` following the above requirements.
- Screen Shots
  - Run your game with a screen size of similar to 640x480 or no larger than 800x600
  - Please don't screen shot your whole desktop with our output as a tiny little window on it.
  - Include 3 screen shots with your game in various states of gameplay.
  - Create an appropriate README file.
    - Describe your project and who worked on it.
    - List all files and link to them in a markdown table.
