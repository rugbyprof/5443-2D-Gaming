"""here's an example code snippet in Pygame that demonstrates how to rotate a sprite towards the position of the mouse click:"""

# Define the sprite image and position
sprite_img = pygame.image.load("sprite.png")

    # Rotate the sprite image
    rotated_sprite = pygame.transform.rotate(sprite_img, math.degrees(angle))
    rotated_rect = rotated_sprite.get_rect(center=sprite_rect.center)

    # Draw the rotated sprite on the screen
    screen.blit(rotated_sprite, rotated_rect)

    # Update the screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Limit the frame rate
    clock.tick(60)

# Quit the game
pygame.quit()

"""
In this example, we use the math.atan2() function to calculate the angle between the sprite and the mouse position. We then use the pygame.transform.rotate() function to rotate the sprite image by the calculated angle, and draw the rotated sprite on the screen.

Note that in this example, the sprite image is assumed to be named "sprite.png" and located in the same directory as the Python script. You will need to modify this code to use your own sprite image file.
